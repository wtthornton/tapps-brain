  Orchestrate a parallel review-fix-validate pipeline across multiple changed files.
  Spawns tapps-review-fixer agents for parallel processing.
mcp_tools:
  - tapps_validate_changed
  - tapps_checklist
  - tapps_session_start

Run a parallel review-fix-validate pipeline on changed Python files:

1. Call `tapps_session_start` if not already called
2. Determine scope: detect changed Python files via git diff or accept a file list
3. For each file (or batch of files), spawn a `tapps-review-fixer` agent:
   - Pass the file path and instructions to score, fix, and gate the file
4. Wait for all agents to complete and collect their results
5. Review and merge any changes
6. Call `tapps_validate_changed` with explicit `file_paths` to verify all files pass
7. Call `tapps_checklist(task_type="review")` for final verification
8. Present a summary table: file | before score | after score | gate | fixes applied
