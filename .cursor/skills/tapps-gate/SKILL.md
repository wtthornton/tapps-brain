Run a quality gate check using TappsMCP:

1. Call `tapps_quality_gate` with the current project
2. Display the overall pass/fail result clearly
3. List each failing criterion with its actual vs. required value
4. If the gate fails, list the minimum changes required to pass
5. Do not declare work complete if the gate has not passed
