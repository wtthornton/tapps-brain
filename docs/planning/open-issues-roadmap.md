# Open Issues Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-04-02 (**#52** checklist reconciled + **closed** on GitHub; **#51**, **#63**, **#64** closed; **EPIC-042.5** composite-weight docs + shared sum validation on `main`; **EPIC-042.7** injection tokenizer hook + telemetry on `main`)
Owner: @wtthornton

## Purpose

Track delivery status for currently open GitHub issues, prioritized by value and dependency order.

**Canonical queue for shipped product work** in this repo (humans, Cursor, CI context): status and order here are what matter for releases and issue hygiene. Ralph’s `.ralph/fix_plan.md` is a **separate, non-packaged** loop driver — see [Open issues roadmap vs Ralph tooling](PLANNING.md#open-issues-roadmap-vs-ralph-tooling) in `PLANNING.md`.

## Status Legend

- `not_started` - No implementation work started
- `in_progress` - Active implementation underway
- `blocked` - Waiting on dependency/decision
- `done` - Implemented, validated, and ready to close
- `closed` - GitHub issue closed

## Priority Order

**Shipped / closed on GitHub:** #30, #15, #45, #12, #23, #17, #19, #18, #40, #21, #20, **#46**, **#48**, **#47** (mitigated), **#49** (v1 `memory_group` epic complete)

**Closed on GitHub (EPIC-041):**

- **[#51](https://github.com/wtthornton/tapps-brain/issues/51)** — federation hub `memory_group` (49-E); STORY-041.1.
- **[#52](https://github.com/wtthornton/tapps-brain/issues/52)** — Hive `agent_scope` `group:<name>` + membership + recall namespace union; STORY-041.2 (**closed** on GitHub — checklist aligned with `main`).
- **[#63](https://github.com/wtthornton/tapps-brain/issues/63)** — `retrieval_effective_mode` / `retrieval_summary` on health (CLI + MCP); STORY-041.3.
- **[#64](https://github.com/wtthornton/tapps-brain/issues/64)** — [`hive-vs-federation.md`](../guides/hive-vs-federation.md); STORY-041.4.

**Further backlog (no GitHub issue yet — file when scheduled):** architecture review follow-ups; clarity / observability / optional refactors—not emergency fixes.

5. **Save-path and maintenance observability** — Optional metrics or structured logging for **auto-consolidation** and other save-adjacent work so large stores can correlate latency with consolidation/GC.
6. **Concurrency and scaling notes** — Document realistic expectations for **threading.Lock** + synchronous SQLite under concurrent MCP/CLI use; optional follow-up issue for lock-hold timing or queue depth if product needs it.
7. **MemoryStore modularization (epic)** — Long-term refactor to split orchestration into smaller facades behind a stable public API; only with sustained pain or capacity.

**Closed epic #49 (v1 recap):** schema **v16** `memory_group`, store/retrieval/recall, MCP (`group` + `memory_list_groups`), CLI (`--group`, `store groups`), [`memory-scopes.md`](../guides/memory-scopes.md), relay [`memory-relay.md`](../guides/memory-relay.md). Child slices 49-A–D were delivered on `main` without separate GitHub children; see [#49](https://github.com/wtthornton/tapps-brain/issues/49) closure comment.

**Shipped in repo (2026-03-28 PR):**

- **#46** — `assemble()` / recall injection: MCP `CallToolResult` unwrapping in
  `openclaw-plugin` (`mcp_tool_text` / `McpClient.callTool`) + `value` on recall summaries in
  `inject_memories`. *Manual check:* OpenClaw session → `assemble()` shows text from existing
  memories.
- **#48** — Subagent / odd tiers: `normalize_save_tier` (`tier_normalize.py`) in
  `MemoryStore.save`, `memory_save` MCP, relay import; profile layer names before global
  aliases (e.g. `UNKNOWN_TIER` → `pattern` or profile layer). *Manual check:* save with a
  weird tier and confirm stored tier in DB/recall.
- **#47** — Tool-name collisions mitigated: plugin exposes `tapps_memory_search` /
  `tapps_memory_get`; troubleshooting in `docs/guides/openclaw.md`. Stronger follow-up (e.g.
  MCP `--tool-prefix` on the host) can be a new issue if needed.

**Recently shipped (repo + GitHub closed 2026-03-28):** #18 hive push, #40 adaptive hybrid fusion, #21 store stale, #20 profile migrate

## Roadmap by Week

### Week 1 - Core Retrieval Foundation

- [x] **#30** `feat: integrate sqlite-vec for local vector search`
  - Status: `done` (optional `sqlite-vec` in `[vector]` + dev; `memory_vec` vec0; hybrid prefers KNN when enabled)
  - Target outcome: local semantic search available without external API dependency
  - Notes: establish optional dependency + safe fallback path; begin with schema + embedding write path

- [x] **#15** `feat: diagnostics health command + MCP tool`
  - Status: `done` (CLI `diagnostics health`, MCP `tapps_brain_health`, store report includes sqlite-vec fields)
  - Target outcome: verify acceptance criteria against current code and close if complete
  - Notes: quick validation/documentation; floated from former Week 6 slot so the issue can close early

### Week 2 - Adoption and Usage Quality

- [x] **#45** `feat: Profile-driven agent onboarding`
  - Status: `done` (`tapps-brain profile onboard`, MCP `memory_profile_onboarding`)
  - Target outcome: agents receive structured profile-based memory usage guidance
  - Notes: include CLI and MCP access

### Week 3 - Real-Time Multi-Agent Coordination

- [x] **#12** `feat: Hive push notifications / pub-sub`
  - Status: `done` (monotonic `hive_write_notify` revision; `tapps-brain hive watch`; MCP `hive_write_revision` / `hive_wait_write`; sidecar `~/.tapps-brain/hive/.hive_write_notify`)
  - Target outcome: subscribed agents can react to hive writes in near real time
  - Notes: v1 is poll/long-poll + file signal; optional native push (WAL/socket) later

### Week 4 - Security Hardening

- [x] **#23** `feat: SQLCipher support`
  - Status: `done` (`[encryption]` extra / `pysqlcipher3`; `sqlcipher_util` + `encryption_migrate`; `MemoryPersistence` / `FeedbackStore` / `DiagnosticsHistoryStore` / `HiveStore` / `MemoryStore`; CLI `maintenance encrypt-db|decrypt-db|rekey-db`; `StoreHealthReport.sqlcipher_enabled`; `docs/guides/sqlcipher.md`)
  - Target outcome: optional encrypted-at-rest SQLite backend with migration paths
  - Notes: include key management docs and fallback behavior

### Week 5 - Interop + Search Quality

- [x] **#19** `feat: Sub-agent memory relay`
  - Status: `done` (`memory_relay` parser + `import_relay_to_store`; CLI `tapps-brain relay import` file or `--stdin`; MCP `tapps_brain_relay_export`; `docs/guides/memory-relay.md`; batch context `memory_relay`)
  - Target outcome: portable relay format + import/export path
  - Notes: invalid rows skipped with warnings

- [x] **#40** `feat: adaptive query-aware hybrid search fusion`
  - Status: `done` (2026-03-28) — `hybrid_rrf_weights_for_query`, weighted RRF in `MemoryRetriever._get_hybrid_candidates`; `hybrid_config.adaptive_fusion=False` restores 1:1 weights
  - Dependency: #30 sqlite-vec shipped
  - Target outcome: query-aware BM25/vector weighting improves mixed-query relevance
  - Notes: deterministic heuristics; no LLM

### Week 6 - Workflow and Ops Polish

- [x] **#18** `feat: hive push / push-tagged`
  - Status: `done` (2026-03-28) — CLI `hive push` / `hive push-tagged`; MCP `hive_push`; `PropagationEngine` `dry_run` / `bypass_profile_hive_rules`; `select_local_entries_for_hive_push` + `push_memory_entries_to_hive`
  - Target outcome: low-friction promotion of project memories to hive
  - Notes: `--dry-run`, `--force`; **#18** closed on GitHub 2026-03-28

- [x] **#21** `feat: store stale`
  - Status: `done` (2026-03-28) — `MemoryGarbageCollector.stale_candidate_details`, `MemoryStore.list_gc_stale_details`, CLI `maintenance stale`, MCP `maintenance_stale`; `maintenance gc` / MCP `maintenance_gc` / `store.gc` / `health()` use profile decay + `gc_config`

- [x] **#20** `feat: profile migrate`
  - Status: `done` (2026-03-28) — `profile_migrate` helpers, `MemoryStore.migrate_entry_tiers`, CLI `profile migrate-tiers --map from:to`, MCP `profile_tier_migrate` (`tier_map_json`, `dry_run`); audit action `tier_migrate`

- [x] **#17** `feat: session summarization`
  - Status: `closed` on GitHub (2026-03-28) — `tapps-brain session end`, `session_summary.py`, MCP `tapps_brain_session_end`; optional `--daily-note`
  - Target outcome: end-of-session episodic capture (CLI + Python API + MCP)

## Recommended next steps (2026-04-02)

- **#52** — done (GitHub issue body checklist updated + issue closed).

**Next engineering (canonical queue)**

- **Save-path observability** (tracking row 20): phase histograms on `MemoryStore.save`; **`StoreHealthReport.save_phase_summary`** + `HealthReport.store.save_phase_summary` (MCP `tapps_brain_health` reuses live store; CLI cold health may stay empty for phases).
- **MemoryStore decomposition** (tracking row 22): design-first only; see **EPIC-050** / **EPIC-051** for concurrency and scale framing.

**Done in repo (was backlog item 6)**

- **Concurrency expectations** for operators: [`system-architecture.md`](../engineering/system-architecture.md) § *Concurrency model* — threading + SQLite under MCP/CLI; file a code issue only if benchmarks show a real pain point.
