# TappsMCP PreToolUse hook — session-start enforcement gate.
# Blocks TappsMCP quality tools until tapps_session_start has actually run this
# Claude session (proven by a tool-written .session-start-done-<SID> sentinel,
# not merely the SessionStart hook firing). Mode is baked in at install time:
# "warn" logs to .session-start-gate-violations.jsonl and allows; "block"
# exits 2. Bypass with TAPPS_SKIP_SESSION_START_GATE=1 (logged to
# .tapps-mcp/.bypass-log.jsonl).

[TappsMCP refusal layer=hook-only/defense-in-depth] session-start gate (warn) — ${TOOL} was called before tapps_session_start ran this session.
Call tapps_session_start() first: it bootstraps project context, the checker matrix, and brain auth. Without it, quality verdicts are degraded.
This call is allowed (warn mode) but logged to .tapps-mcp/.session-start-gate-violations.jsonl.
